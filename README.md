# Road_Construction

This project, Road Construction, was initiated by Qixiu Fu (CAS 2020), collaborated with Dongqi Bao and advised by Wei Ji Ma as part of Qixiu’s senior honors thesis. Preparation of this project including literature research and experimental design started in July 2019, and with the support from Dongqi, in-lab experiment was ready in February 2020 and pilot data collection was completed yet limited by COVID-19 outbreak in March (N = 3). Despite unexpected situations, Qixiu completed her thesis in May. 

This project examined the intersection of mental simulation and spatial planning. We were curious whether mental simulation can facilitate spatial planning knowing that generating sequences of future outcomes to achieve a long-term goal can be cognitively challenging. In the road construction task, we asked our subjects to connect as many cities as possible on a map. In the road construction with undo, subjects had a choice to undo to explore alternative planning outcomes. Finally, in the number estimation task, we tried to approximate subjects' ability of mental simulation without the need to plan. Based on our pilot analysis, we found subjects connected more cities with undo, it took them longer to make their first choice without undo, and subjects’ number estimation was less accurate when they needed to simulate a longer path. 

To understand this project in a nutshell, you can watch this [5-minute presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhSZ81e3UQc). For a more detailed account of the experimental design, pilot data, and analysis, you can read the [thesis here](https://www.academia.edu/43098314/Aiding_Mental_Simulation_in_Spatial_Planning). Qixiu mainly coded the experiments with support from Dongqi, collected pilot data, and wrote the thesis. Modeling and data analysis was done by Dongqi. All work and progress were advised and supervised by Wei Ji Ma.

This Github depository was created by Dongqi and it stores the in-lab experiments code, data analysis, modelling, and draft code for the online adaptation of the road construction task.

---Folder Descriptions---
